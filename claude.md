# RPM Finance Website

## Project Overview

RPM Finance is a consulting firm that helps senior management of quality compounder companies address the "sector fit" problem in public markets. Companies that don't fit cleanly into narrow sector definitions are systematically undervalued by sector-focused trading teams. RPM Finance offers consulting services and investment outlook frameworks to help these companies reposition their investment story and earn the valuation multiple they deserve.

## Founder

**Robert P. McCarthy, CFA** - Expert in this problem from his background as:
- Sell-side analyst (Morgan Stanley, Banc of America, Oppenheimer, Stifel, Stephens) - 15 years covering Electrical Equipment/Multi-Industry
- Buy-side portfolio manager (UBS O'Connor) - Managed $500M+ portfolio across 100+ industrial stocks, outperformed XLI & S&P 500 every year
- McKinsey Expert Associate Partner (2020-2025) - Advised industrial clients on investor relations, strategic messaging, investor perception studies

## Original Prompt

> Use the front-end design skill to make a compelling, innovative, professional home page for RPM Finance, which helps senior management of companies that are quality compounders but that don't fit cleanly into public market investors' narrow sector definitions. This sector fit problem is getting bigger because trading teams with a narrow sector focus are coming to dominate trading in public markets. RPM Finance offers consulting services and investment outlook frameworks that help companies position their investment outlook differently to address this problem and earn the valuation multiple they really deserve as quality compounders. RPM Finance is run by Rob McCarthy, who is expert in this problem from his background as a sell-side analyst, a buy-side portfolio manager, and a McKinsey expert associate partner, focused on serving advanced industrial partners in those roles. Specific clients successed from the past are described here: @Rob McCarthy Resume Summer 25.docx . Use the content just described above but frame it using the Adam Frankl story framework described here: @Frankl framework for landing page.pdf

## Frankl Framework Structure Used

The landing page follows the Adam Frankl story framework:

1. **Inciting Event** - The Villain (Pain), Hero (user), Wise Advisor (RPM), Gift (the service)
2. **Obstacles Overcome** - List of challenges with testimonial-style evidence
3. **User Triumph** - Overall success measurement

### Applied to RPM Finance:
- **Villain**: Sector-focused trading teams with rigid mandates undervaluing quality compounders
- **Hero**: Senior management teams frustrated that excellent fundamentals aren't reflected in valuation multiples
- **Wise Advisor**: Robert P. McCarthy with triple expertise (analyst, PM, McKinsey)
- **Gift**: Investment outlook frameworks, investor perception studies, Q&A simulation, strategic portfolio advisory

## Design Decisions

### Visual Identity
- **Color Palette**: Deep navy (#0a0e1a) with gold accents (#c9a227) - premium, sophisticated finance aesthetic
- **Typography**: Cormorant Garamond (elegant serif display) + DM Sans (clean body text)
- **Logo**: Tachometer/gauge icon symbolizing "RPM" as acceleration - representing acceleration of client valuation multiples

### Key Features
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Fixed navigation with scroll-aware styling
- Subtle grain texture overlay
- Abstract geometric patterns and chart-line animations
- No stock photos - data-inspired visuals only
